<p> I really like journaling for thinking. Journaling probably means different things to different people, but to me it means writing in a notebook day after day, usually developping a single idea, days at a time.</p>

<p> Journaling on the web is different though. And I'm curious about it. There are many things that distinguish from journalling in a notebook:
<ul>
<li> It is easily shareable
<li> You can program the contents of the site
<li> You can link pages.<small> (It is a hypertext medium)</small> 
</ul>
